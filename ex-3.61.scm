;;; Exercise 3.61.  Let S be a power series (exercise 3.59) whose constant term
;;; is 1. Suppose we want to find the power series 1/S, that is, the series
;;; X such that S · X = 1. Write S = 1 + S_R where S_R is the part of S after
;;; the constant term. Then we can solve for X as follows:
;;;
;;;       S・X = 1
;;; (1+S_R)・X = 1
;;; X + S_R・X = 1
;;;          X = 1 - S_R・X
;;;
;;; In other words, X is the power series whose constant term is 1 and whose
;;; higher-order terms are given by the negative of S_R times X. Use this idea
;;; to write a procedure invert-unit-series that computes 1/S for a power
;;; series S with constant term 1. You will need to use mul-series from
;;; exercise 3.60.

(define (invert-unit-series S)
  (define X (cons-stream 1
                         (mul-series (scale-stream (stream-cdr S) -1)
                                     X)))
  X)
