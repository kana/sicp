The former is evaluated as follos:

    (+ 4 5)
    (if (= 4 0) 5 (inc (+ (dec 4) 5)))
    (inc (+ (dec 4) 5))
    (inc (+ 3 5))
    (inc (if (= 3 0) 5 (inc (+ (dec 3) 5))))
    (inc (inc (+ (dec 3) 5)))
    (inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
    ...
    (inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
    ...
    (inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
    (inc (inc (inc (inc (if (= 0 0) 5 (inc (+ (dec 0) 5)))))))
    (inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
    (inc (inc (inc 6)))
    (inc (inc 7))
    (inc 8)
    9

Therefore the former is recursive.

The latter is evaluatd as follows:

	(+ 4 5)
	(if (= 4 0) 5 (+ (dec 4) (inc 5)))
	(+ (dec 4) (inc 5))
	(+ 3 6)
	(if (= 3 0) 6 (+ (dec 3) (inc 6)))
	(+ (dec 3) (inc 6))
	(+ 2 7)
	...
	(+ 1 8)
	...
	(+ 0 9)
	(if (= 0 0) 9 (+ (dec 0) (inc 9)))
	9

Therefore the latter is iterative.
