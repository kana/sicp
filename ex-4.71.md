> Exercise 4.71.  Louis Reasoner wonders why the `simple-query` and `disjoin`

> ```scheme
> (define (simple-query query-pattern frame-stream)
>   (stream-flatmap
>    (lambda (frame)
>      (stream-append (find-assertions query-pattern frame)
>                     (apply-rules query-pattern frame)))
>    frame-stream))
> (define (disjoin disjuncts frame-stream)
>   (if (empty-disjunction? disjuncts)
>       the-empty-stream
>       (interleave
>        (qeval (first-disjunct disjuncts) frame-stream)
>        (disjoin (rest-disjuncts disjuncts) frame-stream))))
> ```

> Can you give examples of queries where these simpler definitions would lead
