;;; Exercise 3.77.  The integral procedure used above was analogous to the
;;; ``implicit'' definition of the infinite stream of integers in section
;;; 3.5.2. Alternatively, we can give a definition of integral that is more
;;; like integers-starting-from (also in section 3.5.2):
;;;
;;; (define (integral integrand initial-value dt)
;;;   (cons-stream initial-value
;;;                (if (stream-null? integrand)
;;;                    the-empty-stream
;;;                    (integral (stream-cdr integrand)
;;;                              (+ (* dt (stream-car integrand))
;;;                                 initial-value)
;;;                              dt))))
;;;
;;; When used in systems with loops, this procedure has the same problem as
;;; does our original version of integral. Modify the procedure so that it
;;; expects the integrand as a delayed argument and hence can be used in the
;;; solve procedure shown above.

  (cons-stream initial-value
               (let ([integrand (force delayed-integrand)])

                   (integral (delay (stream-cdr integrand))
                             (+ (* dt (stream-car integrand))
                                initial-value)
