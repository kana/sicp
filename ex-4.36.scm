;;; Exercise 4.36.  Exercise 3.69 discussed how to generate the stream of all
;;; Pythagorean triples, with no upper bound on the size of the integers to be
;;; searched.

;;; Explain why simply replacing an-integer-between by an-integer-starting-from
;;; in the procedure in exercise 4.35 is not an adequate way to generate
;;; arbitrary Pythagorean triples.

; TODO

;;; Write a procedure that actually will accomplish this. (That is, write
;;; a procedure for which repeatedly typing try-again would in principle
;;; eventually generate all Pythagorean triples.)
