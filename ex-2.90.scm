;;; Exercise 2.90.  Suppose we want to have a polynomial system that is
;;; efficient for both sparse and dense polynomials. One way to do this is to
;;; allow both kinds of term-list representations in our system. The situation
;;; is analogous to the complex-number example of section 2.4, where we allowed
;;; both rectangular and polar representations. To do this we must distinguish
;;; different types of term lists and make the operations on term lists
;;; generic. Redesign the polynomial system to implement this generalization.
;;; This is a major effort, not a local change.


;; Redefine operations for terms and term lists.
