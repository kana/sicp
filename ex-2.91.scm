;;; Exercise 2.91.  A univariate polynomial can be divided by another one to
;;; produce a polynomial quotient and a polynomial remainder. For example,
;;;
;;; x^5 - 1
;;; ------- = x^3 + x, remainder x - 1
;;; x^2 - 1
;;;
;;; Division can be performed via long division. That is, divide the
;;; highest-order term of the dividend by the highest-order term of the
;;; divisor. The result is the first term of the quotient. Next, multiply the
;;; result by the divisor, subtract that from the dividend, and produce the
;;; rest of the answer by recursively dividing the difference by the divisor.
;;; Stop when the order of the divisor exceeds the order of the dividend and
;;; declare the dividend to be the remainder. Also, if the dividend ever
;;; becomes zero, return zero as both quotient and remainder.
;;;
;;; We can design a div-poly procedure on the model of add-poly and mul-poly.
;;; The procedure checks to see if the two polys have the same variable. If so,
;;; div-poly strips off the variable and passes the problem to div-terms, which
;;; performs the division operation on term lists. Div-poly finally reattaches
;;; the variable to the result supplied by div-terms. It is convenient to
;;; design div-terms to compute both the quotient and the remainder of
;;; a division. Div-terms can take two term lists as arguments and return
;;; a list of the quotient term list and the remainder term list.
;;;
;;; Complete the following definition of div-terms by filling in the missing
;;; expressions. Use this to implement div-poly, which takes two polys as
;;; arguments and returns a list of the quotient and remainder polys.
