;;; Exercise 4.31.  The approach taken in this section is somewhat unpleasant,
;;; because it makes an incompatible change to Scheme. It might be nicer to
;;; implement lazy evaluation as an upward-compatible extension, that is, so
;;; that ordinary Scheme programs will work as before. We can do this by
;;; extending the syntax of procedure declarations to let the user control
;;; whether or not arguments are to be delayed. While we're at it, we may as
;;; well also give the user the choice between delaying with and without
;;; memoization. For example, the definition
;;;
;;;     (define (f a (b lazy) c (d lazy-memo))
;;;       ...)
;;;
;;; would define f to be a procedure of four arguments, where the first and
;;; third arguments are evaluated when the procedure is called, the second
;;; argument is delayed, and the fourth argument is both delayed and memoized.
;;; Thus, ordinary procedure definitions will produce the same behavior as
;;; ordinary Scheme, while adding the lazy-memo declaration to each parameter
;;; of every compound procedure will produce the behavior of the lazy evaluator
;;; defined in this section. Design and implement the changes required to
;;; produce such an extension to Scheme. You will have to implement new syntax
;;; procedures to handle the new syntax for define. You must also arrange for
;;; eval or apply to determine when arguments are to be delayed, and to force
;;; or delay arguments accordingly, and you must arrange for forcing to memoize
;;; or not, as appropriate.
